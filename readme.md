# Langchain Mysql

The purpose of this repo is to get a mysql database up and running in docker and make it queryable via langchain. 
Fortunately, langchain makes this very simple. 


## Usage
```
chmod +x run.sh                    #make executable

run.sh <open_api_key>              #setup python env, a mysql instance, run a langchain docker container, and run some queries
```
